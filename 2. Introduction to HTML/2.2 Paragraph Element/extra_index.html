  What!? I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial
  Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan-- All right. Well, take care of
  yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it?
</p>

<p>
  Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this
  time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to
  know what happened to the plans they sent you. I'm surprised you had the
  courage to take the responsibility yourself.

  Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in
  for it as it is.
</h2>
<p>
  Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. As you wish. I
  suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act
  on instinct. A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the
  presence of my old master.

  Don't underestimate the Force. Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain
  this? Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. As you wish. The more you tighten
  your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.

    Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you,
    Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money.

  All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best
  at, ain't it? Red Five standing by. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. I
  find your lack of faith disturbing. I call it luck.

<p>
  I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I
  hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way
  from here. What!? The Force is strong with this one. I have you now.
</p>

<p>
  Ye-ha! I'm trying not to, kid. But with the blast shield down, I can't even
  see! How am I supposed to fight? Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no
  match for a good blaster at your side, kid.

<p>
  What!? I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? A tremor in the Force. The
  last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. A tremor in the
  Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.
</p>

<p>
  I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want
  to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me. No!
  Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possiblyâ€¦
