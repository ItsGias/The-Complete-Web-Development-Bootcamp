<h1>The Best Animes According to Gian</h1>

<h2>My top 3 favorite animes of that year</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Jujutsu Kaisen</h3>
<p>
  The history and the main characters are amazing, also I loved Satoru Gojo, he
  definitely got my heart.
</p>

<h3>Ōsama Ranking</h3>
<p>
  This anime is probably one of the most adorable and charismatic I've ever
  seen.<br />
  I love you boji S2.

<h3>Gaikotsu Kishi-sama, Tadaima Isekai e Odekake-chū</h3>
<p>
  Probably one of the best animations I've seen, it's a normal Isekai like
  everyone else, but the animation and the powers are so cool!!!
